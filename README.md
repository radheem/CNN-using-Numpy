# CNN-using-Numpy
This repository contains an implementation of a basic CNN from scratch using just the Numpy library.<br>
The code used here is what i learned in the coursera deeplearning.ai specialization course 4 Convolutional Neural Networks in addition with implemented of an ANN.<br>
the implementation is hardcoded to have a softmax output layer and performing mini-batch gradient descent with 60 batches.<br> 
Furthermore the data used in this repo is MNIST dataset which is available at this link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ with instructions to download and use.
